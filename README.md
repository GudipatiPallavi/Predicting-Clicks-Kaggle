# Predicting-Clicks-Kaggle

Project: Predicting Clicks (CTR Prediction) This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the Click-Through Rate (CTR) of display advertisements based on various features such as ad quality, relevance, audience targeting, and content attributes. The goal is to optimize ad performance by understanding the factors that drive user engagement.
Participants will leverage structured data containing ad-specific characteristics (e.g., targeting score, visual appeal, ad format, positioning, sentiment analysis, and audience demographics) to predict CTR. The model will be evaluated based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), aiming for the most accurate predictions.
